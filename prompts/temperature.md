Extract 24 hourly series and include the graph title as location:
- Air temperature (blue line), read from left axis (degC)
- Freezing level (pink line), right axis (metres)
- Wet bulb freezing level (yellow line), right axis (metres)
- Location: copy the graph title text exactly (e.g., "Ben Nevis (1345 metres)"). Do not use page footers/area names and do not add qualifiers like "approx". If you cannot read it, return an empty string.
Hours 18:00 → 17:00 next day. Return exactly 24 entries with these three numeric values.
