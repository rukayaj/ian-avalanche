You are given a full page image from an avalanche forecast PDF. Identify if the page is an area forecast page with three graphs (wind, precipitation, temperature) spanning 24 hours (18:00 → 17:00 next day). If yes, classify page_type as "area_graphs" and return three normalized bounding boxes [x,y,w,h] for the graphs along with their kinds. Also return the location name using only the place name portion of the graph title (e.g., if the title is "Wind - Ben Nevis (1345 metres)" output "Ben Nevis (1345 metres)")—strip any leading graph descriptors such as "Wind - " or "Weather and Precipitation - " before returning it—and avoid using the area footer text at the bottom of the page. Bounding boxes should tightly surround the plot and its legend/title.
